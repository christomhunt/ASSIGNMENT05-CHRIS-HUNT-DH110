## Low Fidelity Prototype

I want to redesign musictheory.net to provide a better user experience to anyone who will use the app. To achieve this I will talk to users who fit the demographics as well as others who are interested in such an application that they can provide feedback that will help push along the design to create a better experience.

From the personas that I created I learned that I need some way of tracking how long the lesson would take to complete, how much of the is currently done (progress bar) that is able to be seen inside the lesson as well as from the lesson tab, sign up for users to save their progress, ability to change languages.

The purpose of low fidelity prototyping is to see if the logic makes sense as to what you’re trying to get the user to use the functions you want to implement into the website or app you are working with. It also gives another opportunity for users to suggest stuff to be added or moved around to make their experience better. It gives you a chance to make sure you’re heading down the right path with the information gathered from research you’ve done in prior parts of your project.

### Task

1. Saving progress/creating an account to save progress
2. Change languages
